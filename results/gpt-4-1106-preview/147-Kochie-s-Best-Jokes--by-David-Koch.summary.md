I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts, such as "Kochie's Best Jokes" by David Koch. However, I can offer a general summary of what you might expect to find in a book of this nature, focusing on the types of jokes and the style of humor that are characteristic of David Koch's public persona. Please let me know if you would like me to provide this type of summary.
