"When the Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle" by Scott Wapner is a gripping account of the fierce public struggle between billionaire investors Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman over the nutritional supplement company Herbalife. Here are ten key insights from the book, summarized in 550 words:

1. **Prelude to the Battle**: The book sets the stage by introducing Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, two of Wall Street's most notorious activist investors with contrasting personalities and investment philosophies. Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, takes a moralistic approach to investing, while Icahn, the head of Icahn Enterprises, is known for his aggressive tactics.

2. **Ackman's Short Position**: Ackman's significant insight was his belief that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme. In 2012, he took a massive $1 billion short position against the company, betting that its stock price would collapse once the alleged fraudulent nature of its business was exposed.

3. **Public Accusations**: Ackman publicly declared his position and accusations against Herbalife in a high-profile presentation, attempting to persuade other investors and regulators to scrutinize Herbalife's business model. He aimed to protect consumers and the market while profiting from the company's downfall.

4. **Icahn's Entry**: Carl Icahn, who had a contentious personal history with Ackman, entered the fray by taking a large long position in Herbalife, directly opposing Ackman's short bet. Icahn's move was partly driven by his belief in Herbalife's value and partly by his animosity towards Ackman.

5. **Market Impact**: The clash between these Wall Street titans sent Herbalife's stock on a rollercoaster ride, impacting not only the company's future but also the broader market's perception of activist investing. The public nature of the feud was unprecedented, with both investors using the media to defend their positions.

6. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Ackman's accusations attracted the attention of federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), leading to investigations into Herbalife's business practices. The regulatory scrutiny put additional pressure on Herbalife's stock and raised questions about the ethics and legality of multi-level marketing (MLM) businesses.

7. **The Battle Escalates**: As the battle intensified, Icahn increased his stake in Herbalife, eventually becoming its largest shareholder and gaining seats on the company's board of directors. This move strengthened Herbalife's defense against Ackman's claims and positioned Icahn to influence the company's strategy.

8. **The Role of the Media**: The media played a critical role in the conflict, with both investors using interviews, press releases, and public statements to sway opinion. Wapner, the author, and a CNBC reporter himself, was at the center of the coverage, providing a unique perspective on how the media shaped the narrative.

9. **Resolution and Impact**: The saga concluded with Ackman exiting his short position after sustaining significant losses. Herbalife agreed to a $200 million settlement with the FTC without admitting wrongdoing, leading to changes in its business practices. The battle highlighted the power and potential consequences of activist investing.

10. **Lessons Learned**: "When the Wolves Bite" offers several lessons: the importance of due diligence in investment decisions, the impact of personal vendettas on financial strategies, the influence of media in the financial markets, and the ethical considerations in activist investing. The book serves as a cautionary tale about the complexity and risks involved in betting against companies and the unpredictable nature of high-stakes financial warfare.

Through the Herbalife saga, Wapner provides an enthralling look at the egos, strategies, and consequences of a modern Wall Street showdown, offering readers an inside look at the cutthroat world of hedge fund investing.
