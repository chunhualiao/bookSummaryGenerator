"Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by Jim Collins is a groundbreaking book that explores the key characteristics and practices of long-lasting, successful companies. Here are the top 10 main points of the book summarized in 600 words:

1. **Clock Building, Not Time Telling**: One of the key concepts in the book is the idea that visionary companies focus on building a strong foundation and enduring principles rather than just reacting to short-term trends or opportunities. They are like clock builders who create lasting mechanisms rather than just telling time.

2. **Core Ideology**: Visionary companies have a strong core ideology that consists of core values and a core purpose. These fundamental beliefs guide the company's decisions and actions over the long term, providing a sense of identity and direction.

3. **BHAGs (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals)**: Visionary companies set ambitious and inspiring long-term goals that push them to achieve greatness. These BHAGs serve as a unifying force and motivate employees to work towards a common vision.

4. **Cult-Like Cultures**: Successful companies cultivate a strong and unique organizational culture that fosters loyalty, commitment, and a sense of belonging among employees. This culture becomes a powerful driver of performance and innovation.

5. **Tyranny of the OR, Embrace of the AND**: Visionary companies reject the notion of trade-offs and instead seek to achieve both/and solutions rather than either/or choices. They find ways to balance seemingly conflicting priorities and embrace paradoxes.

6. **Preserve the Core, Stimulate Progress**: Successful companies maintain a steadfast commitment to their core values and purpose while also continuously evolving and adapting to changing circumstances. They strike a balance between stability and innovation.

7. **Try a Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works**: Visionary companies are not afraid to experiment and take risks. They encourage a culture of innovation and learning, where failures are seen as opportunities for growth and improvement.

8. **Home-Grown Management**: Successful companies prioritize developing and promoting internal talent rather than relying on external hires for leadership positions. They invest in training and mentoring programs to cultivate a pipeline of future leaders.

9. **Good Enough Never Is**: Visionary companies have a relentless pursuit of excellence and a commitment to continuous improvement. They set high standards for performance and quality, always striving to be the best in their industry.

10. **Built to Last**: The overarching theme of the book is that visionary companies are built to stand the test of time. They are driven by a sense of purpose and a set of enduring principles that guide their decisions and actions for generations to come.

In conclusion, "Built to Last" offers valuable insights into the habits and practices of successful companies that have stood the test of time.
