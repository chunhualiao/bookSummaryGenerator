"The Little Book That Still Beats the Market," by Joel Greenblatt, is a guide to stock market investing that introduces the "Magic Formula," a strategy for outperforming the market and selecting winning stocks. Here are the ten most important insights from the book, summarized in 550 words:

1. **Market Efficiency and Emotions**: While the market is generally efficient, it can be swayed by investor emotions. Greenblatt argues that this emotional influence creates opportunities for disciplined investors to profit by exploiting market inefficiencies.

2. **The Magic Formula**: The core of Greenblatt's strategy is the Magic Formula, a quantitative method for selecting stocks. It ranks companies based on a combination of their earnings yield and return on capital. The goal is to buy good businesses at bargain prices.

3. **Earnings Yield**: The earnings yield is a measure of how much a company earns relative to its price, calculated by dividing the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its enterprise value (market value of equity plus net debt). A higher earnings yield indicates a potentially undervalued stock.

4. **Return on Capital**: Return on capital measures how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate profits. It is calculated by dividing EBIT by the sum of net fixed assets and working capital. A higher return on capital suggests a company has a competitive advantage.

5. **Buying Good Companies**: Greenblatt emphasizes the importance of investing in good companies with strong returns on capital. Such companies are likely to sustain their performance and provide better investment returns over the long term.

6. **Buying at Bargain Prices**: The Magic Formula also focuses on purchasing shares of good companies when they are undervalued. By buying at bargain prices, investors can protect themselves against losses and increase their chances of significant gains.

7. **Long-Term Horizon**: The Magic Formula is designed for long-term investing. Greenblatt advises investors to hold stocks for at least one year to see the full effect of the strategy and to benefit from tax advantages on long-term capital gains.

8. **Diversification**: To mitigate risk, Greenblatt recommends diversifying investments across a portfolio of 20-30 stocks selected using the Magic Formula. This reduces the impact of any single stock's performance on the overall portfolio.

9. **Market Fluctuations**: Greenblatt acknowledges that the Magic Formula does not guarantee positive returns every year. Markets can be unpredictable, and even a robust strategy like the Magic Formula will experience periods of underperformance.

10. **Discipline and Patience**: A key insight from the book is the importance of discipline and patience. Investors must stick to the formula even during times when it seems to be underperforming, as consistency and a long-term perspective are critical to achieving above-average market returns.

In conclusion, "The Little Book That Still Beats the Market" provides investors with a straightforward and systematic approach to stock selection. By focusing on a company's earnings yield and return on capital, the Magic Formula aims to identify undervalued, high-quality stocks. Greenblatt's insights emphasize the importance of a long-term investment horizon, diversification, and the need for discipline in following the formula, even when market conditions are challenging. By adhering to these principles, investors can potentially beat the market and achieve significant returns on their investments.
