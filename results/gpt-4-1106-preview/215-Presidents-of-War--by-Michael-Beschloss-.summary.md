2. **Public Opinion and War**: Beschloss emphasizes the importance of public opinion in the presidents' decision-making processes. He shows how leaders such as Polk during the Mexican-American War and McKinley during the Spanish-American War were influenced by both the public's appetite for conflict and the pressure from the press and other politicians.

3. **Civil Liberties in Jeopardy**: The book discusses the suspension of civil liberties during wartime, including Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.

5. **War as a Political Tool**: "Presidents of War" reveals how some presidents have used war as a means to achieve political ends. For example, Beschloss discusses how James K. Polk deliberately provoked a conflict with Mexico to fulfill his expansionist ambitions for the United States.
