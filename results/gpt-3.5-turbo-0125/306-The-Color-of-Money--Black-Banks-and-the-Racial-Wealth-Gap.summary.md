Black individuals and businesses have faced challenges in accessing loans, mortgages, and other financial services from mainstream banks.

6. **Role of Government**: The book explores the role of government policies and regulations in shaping the landscape of black banking. Baradaran argues that government support and intervention are crucial in addressing the racial wealth gap and promoting financial inclusion.

7. **Asset Building**: Black banks have been instrumental in promoting asset building and wealth accumulation within the black community. By providing access to financial services and opportunities for investment, these banks have helped individuals and businesses build wealth over time.

8. **Financial Inclusion**: Baradaran emphasizes the importance of financial inclusion and access to banking services for marginalized communities. Black banks have played a key role in promoting financial literacy and empowerment among black Americans.

9. **Community Empowerment**: The book highlights the role of black banks in fostering community empowerment and economic resilience. By reinvesting in local neighborhoods and supporting black-owned businesses, these banks have contributed to the overall well-being of black communities.

10. **Call to Action**: Baradaran concludes by calling for collective action to address the racial wealth gap and support black banks. She advocates for policy reforms, increased investment in black-owned institutions, and greater awareness of the importance of financial inclusion in narrowing the wealth disparity.

Overall, "The Color of Money" offers a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing black banks in the context of the racial wealth gap.
