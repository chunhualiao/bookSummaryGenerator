"The Man Who Knew Infinity" by Robert Kanigel is a biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a largely self-taught Indian mathematician whose contributions to number theory, continued fractions, and infinite series have significantly influenced the field. Here's a concise summary with ten key insights:

1. **Prodigious Talent in Obscurity**:
Ramanujan grew up in relative obscurity in the town of Kumbakonam in British India. Despite his lack of formal higher education and resources, he developed an extraordinary ability in mathematics, producing complex theorems and computations with little exposure to the broader mathematical community.

2. **Persistence Amidst Hardship**:
Ramanujan faced numerous challenges, including poverty and health issues. His intense focus on mathematics often came at the expense of his physical well-being and financial stability. Despite these hurdles, he continued his mathematical pursuits with unwavering dedication.

3. **Recognition by Hardy**:
Ramanujan's genius was eventually recognized by G.H. Hardy, a prominent mathematician at Cambridge University. Hardy was initially skeptical of Ramanujan's work, which arrived unsolicited, but he soon realized the depth of Ramanujan's raw talent and invited him to Cambridge.

4. **Cultural and Intellectual Contrast**:
Upon arriving in England, Ramanujan encountered a stark contrast between his own intuitive, almost mystical approach to mathematics and the formal, proof-oriented tradition of Western mathematics represented by Hardy and his colleagues.

5. **Collaboration with Hardy**:
Ramanujan's partnership with Hardy led to a prolific period of mathematical research. Hardy provided the rigorous framework that Ramanujan's intuitive insights often lacked, and their collaboration resulted in several published papers and significant contributions to the field.

6. **Influence on Modern Mathematics**:
Ramanujan's work has had a lasting impact on mathematics, influencing areas like number theory, mathematical analysis, and infinite series. His notebooks, filled with theorems and conjectures, have been studied by mathematicians for decades after his death.

7. **Mathematical Intuition**:
Kanigel emphasizes Ramanujan's extraordinary intuition, which allowed him to arrive at complex mathematical truths without formal proofs. His ability to sense the 'right' direction in problem-solving was almost supernatural, and his results were often later proved correct by others.

8. **Struggle with Health and Adaptation**:
Life in England took a significant toll on Ramanujan's health, exacerbated by World War I shortages and his strict vegetarian diet. The cold climate and cultural isolation also affected his productivity and well-being.

9. **Legacy and Tragic Demise**:
Ramanujan's life was cut short at the age of 32 due to illness, likely exacerbated by his time in England. His early death was a profound loss to mathematics, but his legacy lived on through the work he left behind and the inspiration he provided to future mathematicians.

10. **Human Story Behind Mathematics**:
Kanigel's biography not only documents Ramanujan's mathematical achievements but also humanizes him, depicting the person behind the prodigious intellect. It highlights the importance of recognizing and nurturing talent, regardless of its origin, and serves as a poignant reminder of the human element in the pursuit of scientific and mathematical understanding.

These insights from "The Man Who Knew Infinity" showcase the remarkable life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a man whose intellectual feats transcended his circumstances, and whose legacy continues to inspire mathematicians around the world.
