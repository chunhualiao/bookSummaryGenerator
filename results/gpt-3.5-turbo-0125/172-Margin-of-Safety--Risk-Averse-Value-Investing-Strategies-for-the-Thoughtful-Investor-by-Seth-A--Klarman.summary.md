By understanding and capitalizing on these psychological factors, investors can gain a competitive edge in the market.

9. **Portfolio Diversification**: The book discusses the importance of portfolio diversification as a risk management strategy. Klarman advises investors to spread their investments across different asset classes, industries, and geographies to reduce concentration risk and enhance overall portfolio resilience. Diversification can help mitigate losses from individual investment failures and improve long-term returns.
