1. **Power of Choice and Consequences**: The protagonist, Bellis Coldwine, is forced to flee New Crobuzon and makes a series of choices that lead her to the floating pirate city of Armada. Her decisions, and those of other characters, drive the narrative and illustrate the theme that the choices one makes, even under duress, have significant and often unforeseen consequences.

2. **Nature of Scars**: The novel's title, "The Scar," refers not only to a physical location within the book but also symbolizes the emotional and psychological scars that characters carry. These scars shape their identities and destinies, suggesting that wounds and experiences, both physical and emotional, are integral to personal development and history.

3. **Complex Characters**: Miéville populates the book with complex, morally ambiguous characters. From the cold and calculating Bellis to the passionate and revolutionary Silas Fennec, to the enigmatic Uther Doul, each character has depth and contributes to the rich tapestry of the narrative.

4. **Politics and Governance**: Armada is a city of political intrigue and diverse factions, where governance is a complicated affair. The novel explores various systems of rule and the tensions between them, highlighting the difficulties in balancing power, freedom, and security within a society.

5. **The Quest for Knowledge**: The leaders of Armada are on a quest to harness the power of an enigmatic rift in reality known as the Scar. This pursuit of knowledge and power, regardless of the cost, reflects the human desire to understand and control the unknown. The novel questions the ethics of such endeavors and their impact on the world.

6. **Cultural Diversity and Integration**: Armada is a melting pot of races and cultures, including humans, the vampiric Anophelii, and the sentient cactacae. The city exemplifies both the challenges and the potential of cultural integration, as different groups strive to live together while maintaining their distinct identities.

7. **Love and Loyalty**: Relationships in "The Scar" are tested by the harsh realities of life in Armada. Characters such as Bellis and Tanner Sack, a Remade prisoner, navigate personal loyalties and romantic entanglements, underscoring the themes of love, trust, and betrayal.

8. **The Power of Language**: Bellis, a linguist by trade, understands the power of language to control, define, and manipulate. The novel delves into the role of language in shaping reality and the way it can be used as a tool for power.

9. **The Monstrous and the Other**: Miéville's world is filled with monstrous beings that challenge conventional notions of beauty and terror. The novel prompts readers to consider the nature of monstrosity and the arbitrary distinctions between "us" and "them," often highlighting the humanity within the monstrous.

10. **The Infinite and the Finite**: The Scar represents the idea of infinite possibility, a place where reality is mutable. The novel contrasts this infinity with the finite nature of human lives and endeavors. It poses existential questions about the significance of individual actions within an incomprehensibly vast universe.

It challenges readers to reflect on the complexity of society, the politics of coexistence, and the fundamental human desire to explore and understand the unknown.
