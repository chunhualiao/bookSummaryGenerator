This serves as a critique of the overemphasis on superficial academic achievements and the pretensions of intellectualism.

2. The Paradox of Human Relationships: The novel illustrates the complexities and contradictions within human relationships. Fang Hongjian’s engagements and marriages reveal the conflicting desires for freedom and commitment, intimacy and independence.

5. The Irony of Warfare: "Fortress Besieged" draws parallels between the personal battles of its characters and the literal warfare happening around them.
