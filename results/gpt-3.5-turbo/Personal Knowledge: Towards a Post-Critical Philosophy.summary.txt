"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy" by Michael Polanyi is a seminal work that challenges the traditional view of knowledge as detached and objective, advocating instead for a more personal and subjective understanding of knowledge. Here are the top 10 main points of the book:

1. **Critique of Objectivity**: Polanyi critiques the prevailing view of scientific knowledge as purely objective and detached from personal involvement. He argues that knowledge is inherently personal and involves tacit elements that go beyond explicit rules and procedures.

2. **Tacit Knowledge**: Polanyi introduces the concept of tacit knowledge, which refers to the personal, intuitive, and embodied knowledge that individuals possess but cannot fully articulate. He emphasizes the importance of tacit knowledge in shaping our understanding of the world.

3. **Personal Participation**: According to Polanyi, knowledge is not a passive reception of information but an active process of personal participation and engagement. Individuals bring their own experiences, beliefs, and commitments to the process of knowing.

4. **Indwelling**: Polanyi introduces the notion of indwelling, which refers to the intimate connection between the knower and the known. He argues that knowledge is rooted in our personal engagement with the world and cannot be separated from our subjective experiences.

5. **Scientific Discovery**: Polanyi challenges the notion of scientific discovery as a purely rational and objective process. He argues that scientific discoveries often involve personal intuitions, hunches, and creative leaps that go beyond logical reasoning.

6. **Tacit Knowing in Science**: Polanyi highlights the role of tacit knowledge in scientific inquiry, emphasizing the importance of personal judgment, intuition, and skill in scientific practice. He argues that scientists rely on tacit knowledge to guide their research and make breakthroughs.

7. **Authority and Tradition**: Polanyi discusses the role of authority and tradition in shaping our knowledge and beliefs. He argues that individuals often rely on the expertise of others and trust in established traditions to guide their understanding of the world.

8. **Personal Commitment**: Polanyi emphasizes the importance of personal commitment in the pursuit of knowledge. He argues that individuals must be willing to take risks, make judgments, and stand by their beliefs in order to advance their understanding.

9. **Limits of Objectivity**: Polanyi critiques the limitations of objectivity and argues that knowledge is always situated within a personal and subjective context. He suggests that embracing the personal dimension of knowledge can lead to a more holistic and meaningful understanding of the world.

10. **Post-Critical Philosophy**: In advocating for a post-critical philosophy, Polanyi calls for a reevaluation of the traditional dualisms between subject and object, theory and practice, and reason and emotion. He argues for a more integrated and holistic approach to knowledge that recognizes the personal, embodied, and contextual nature of human understanding.

Overall, "Personal Knowledge" presents a compelling argument for a more personal and participatory approach to knowledge that challenges the dominant paradigms of objectivity and detachment. Polanyi's insights into tacit knowledge, personal commitment, and the limitations of objectivity continue to influence contemporary discussions in philosophy, science, and education.
