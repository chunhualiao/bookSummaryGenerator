"My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla" is a rich account of the life and mind of one of history's most brilliant and enigmatic inventors. Here are ten key insights from the book, distilled into a concise summary:

1. **Early Life and Education**: Tesla's formative years were marked by an intense curiosity and a powerful visual imagination. He credited his mother's inventiveness and his father's scholarly background for shaping his intellectual pursuits. His ability to visualize objects and experiments in his mind without the need for physical models would become a defining characteristic of his inventive process.

2. **Discovery of Alternating Current (AC)**: Tesla's realization of the potential of alternating current was a pivotal point in his career. He recognized that AC could be more efficiently transmitted over long distances than direct current (DC). This insight set the stage for the "War of Currents," where Tesla's AC system would eventually triumph over Edison's DC.

3. **Move to America**: Seeking to expand his opportunities, Tesla immigrated to the United States in 1884. He arrived with little more than a letter of introduction to Thomas Edison. His time with Edison was short-lived due to conflicting views, particularly on the AC versus DC systems, leading Tesla to pursue his own path.

4. **Invention of the Tesla Coil**: The Tesla coil, capable of producing high-voltage, high-frequency alternating currents, was a significant breakthrough. It had various applications, from wireless transmission to lighting, and demonstrated Tesla's deep understanding of electromagnetic fields.

5. **Wireless Technology Vision**: Tesla foresaw the possibility of wireless communication and power transmission. He worked on the Wardenclyffe Tower project, aiming to provide free wireless energy worldwide. Although the project was never completed, Tesla's ideas laid the groundwork for future wireless technologies.

6. **Innovations in Electrical Engineering**: Tesla's contributions to electrical engineering were vast. He developed the polyphase alternating current system, including generators, motors, and transformers, which became the standard for global power transmission and are still in use today.

7. **Concept of Remote Control**: Tesla devised one of the first remote-controlled boats, demonstrating it in 1898. This invention was a precursor to modern remote-controlled devices and signaled the beginning of robotics and automation.

8. **Influence on Modern Technologies**: Tesla's experiments with X-rays, radio waves, and the Tesla turbine, among others, have influenced the development of various technologies. His work with radio frequency and resonance continues to inform fields such as medical imaging and telecommunications.

9. **Financial Struggles and Recognition**: Despite his genius, Tesla often struggled financially due to his lack of business acumen and focus on pure research over commercialization. He received numerous accolades for his work, but his financial situation remained precarious throughout his life.

10. **Philosophical and Humanitarian Outlook**: Tesla held a vision for improving humanity's condition through free, unlimited energy. He believed in the importance of fostering peace and understanding among nations and saw technological advancement as a means to these ends.

In summary, "My Inventions" reveals Tesla as a visionary who not only shaped the future of electrical engineering but also imagined a world transformed by technology for the betterment of humanity. His autobiography offers a window into the mind of a man whose genius continues to inspire innovation and whose legacy endures in our modern world.
