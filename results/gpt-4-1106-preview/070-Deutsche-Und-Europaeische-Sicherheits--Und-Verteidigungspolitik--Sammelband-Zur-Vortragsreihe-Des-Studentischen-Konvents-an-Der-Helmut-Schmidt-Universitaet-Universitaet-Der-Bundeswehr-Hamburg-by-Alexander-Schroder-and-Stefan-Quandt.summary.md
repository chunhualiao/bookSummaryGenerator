I'm sorry, but I'm unable to provide a summary of the book "Deutsche Und Europaeische Sicherheits- Und Verteidigungspolitik: Sammelband Zur Vortragsreihe Des Studentischen Konvents an Der Helmut-Schmidt-Universitaet-Universitaet Der Bundeswehr Hamburg" by Alexander Schroder and Stefan Quandt as it is not in the public domain and it is not one of the sources that I have access to. However, I can offer general insights about German and European security and defense policy based on publicly available information up to my knowledge cutoff date. If that would be helpful, please let me know.
