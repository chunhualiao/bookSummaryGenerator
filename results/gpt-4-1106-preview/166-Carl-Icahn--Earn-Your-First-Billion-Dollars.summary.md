Here are ten key insights, summarized within the 550-word limit:

1. **Activist Investing**: Icahn is known for his aggressive style of activist investing, where he purchases substantial stakes in underperforming companies and pushes for changes to increase shareholder value. This involves advocating for strategic divestitures, management changes, or operational improvements.
