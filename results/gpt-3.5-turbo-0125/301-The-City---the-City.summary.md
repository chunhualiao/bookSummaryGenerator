Breach's methods and motivations remain enigmatic throughout the novel, adding an element of suspense and intrigue.

2. **Unseeing**: The concept of unseeing is central to the functioning of the two cities, as residents are trained from a young age to ignore anything from the other city that crosses their path. This willful ignorance is essential for maintaining the separation between Ul Qoma and Besźel.

3. **Crosshatching**: Crosshatching refers to the areas where the two cities overlap, creating zones where residents must navigate carefully to avoid breaching the social boundaries. These areas are a physical representation of the complexity and tension inherent in the dual existence of Ul Qoma and Besźel.

His journey forces him to question his own perceptions and beliefs.

5. **Nationalism and Identity**: The novel explores the ways in which nationalism and identity are constructed and maintained within the two cities. Residents are deeply entrenched in their respective city's culture and history, leading to a sense of loyalty and division that is reinforced by the strict social codes.

6. **Cultural Differences**: Despite existing in the same physical space, Ul Qoma and Besźel have distinct cultural norms, languages, and customs that set them apart. These differences contribute to the sense of otherness and separation between the two cities, highlighting the complexities of coexistence.
