As of my last update, "The Future of Enterprise Applications" by Bernd Leukert and Hasso Plattner has not been summarized in a widely recognized publication or review. However, I can provide a hypothetical concise summary of what such a book might cover, given the expertise and backgrounds of the authors in enterprise software and applications:

1. **Digital Transformation**: The authors likely emphasize the importance of digital transformation in modern businesses, explaining how enterprise applications are critical in driving change and enabling companies to adapt to new market conditions, customer needs, and technological advancements.

2. **Integration of Advanced Technologies**: Leukert and Plattner might explore how technologies like AI, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being integrated into enterprise applications to improve decision-making, automate processes, and create smarter, more responsive systems.

3. **Real-time Data Processing**: The book probably highlights the shift towards in-memory computing and the ability to process large volumes of data in real time, allowing businesses to gain instant insights and respond quickly to changing situations.

4. **User Experience**: Given the focus on end-users, the authors would likely discuss the significance of user experience (UX) in the design of enterprise applications, stressing the need for intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance productivity and satisfaction.

5. **Cloud Computing**: The text might cover the role of cloud computing in enterprise applications, including the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. The authors would discuss different deployment models (public, private, hybrid) and how businesses can leverage the cloud for competitive advantage.

6. **Security and Compliance**: Security being a top concern, the book would address the challenges and strategies for securing enterprise applications, including data protection, privacy regulations, and the management of cyber threats.

7. **Customization and Flexibility**: The authors would probably point out the need for enterprise applications to be customizable to fit the unique processes and needs of different businesses, along with the importance of modular designs that allow for easy updates and scalability.

8. **Collaboration and Communication**: An insight into how enterprise applications are breaking down silos and fostering collaboration both internally and externally (with partners and customers) might be included, demonstrating how integrated communication tools enhance productivity and innovation.

9. **Business Intelligence and Analytics**: Leukert and Plattner might delve into how enterprise applications are equipped with advanced analytics and business intelligence capabilities, enabling companies to derive actionable insights from their data for better strategic planning and operational efficiency.

10. **Future Trends and Predictions**: Lastly, the book would likely offer predictions about the future trajectory of enterprise applications, including potential disruptions, emerging technologies, and the evolving role of IT in business strategy.

These insights would reflect the authors' wealth of experience in the field of enterprise software and would be aimed at guiding business leaders, IT professionals, and software developers in understanding and leveraging the potential of modern enterprise applications to drive business success. Please note that for the actual content of the book, it would be best to refer directly to the text or to a credible summary or review.
