I'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be a book titled "Notebook: You Have The Same Amount Of Hours In A Day As Masayoshi Son" by Masayoshi Son. Masayoshi Son is the founder and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., and while he is a well-known figure in the business world, there is no record of a book with that specific title authored by him.

However, I can provide you with a hypothetical summary based on Masayoshi Son's known business philosophies and practices, which might capture what such a book could potentially cover if it did exist. Please note that this is an imaginative exercise and not based on an actual publication:

1. **Visionary Thinking**: Masayoshi Son is known for his long-term vision, often planning decades into the future. The book would likely emphasize the importance of having a clear, ambitious vision and working relentlessly towards it.

2. **Risk-Taking**: Son has taken significant risks in his career, such as investing billions in Alibaba when it was still a young company. The book might teach the value of calculated risk-taking and not being afraid of potential failure.

3. **Time Management**: It's probable that Son would share insights into effective time management, perhaps advocating for focusing on high-impact activities and delegating lesser tasks to maximize the use of his hours.

4. **Innovation**: As someone at the forefront of tech investment, Son would stress the need for constant innovation and staying ahead of technological trends to remain competitive.

5. **Learning from Mistakes**: Son has experienced spectacular failures, such as the loss he incurred during the dot-com bubble burst. The book would likely address the importance of learning from mistakes and using them as stepping stones to success.

6. **Global Mindset**: With investments around the world, Son would encourage thinking globally and seeking opportunities beyond one's home market.

7. **Building Relationships**: The book might highlight Son's approach to building and maintaining relationships with other industry leaders and the importance of a strong network.

8. **Investing in People**: Son believes in investing in people as much as in companies. The book could provide insights on spotting talent and nurturing it to build a successful team.

9. **Adaptability**: Son's business ventures have spanned various industries, suggesting a theme of adaptability and flexibility in business to pivot when necessary.

10. **Perseverance**: Throughout his career, Son has faced many challenges but has never given up. The book would likely inspire readers to persist despite setbacks, emphasizing perseverance as a key to success.

While these points are speculative and based on Masayoshi Son's known business philosophy, they could represent the kind of insights one might expect from a book that details his approach to life and business. Remember, since the book you mentioned does not actually exist, the above summary is a fictional construct and should be treated as such.
