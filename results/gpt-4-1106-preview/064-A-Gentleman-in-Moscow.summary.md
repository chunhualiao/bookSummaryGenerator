4. **The Role of Chance**: The novel suggests that life is a series of chance encounters and events. Rostov's friendship with the hotel staff, his relationship with the actress Anna Urbanova, and his role in the life of the young girl Nina all occur by happenstance, shaping his life in unexpected ways.

5. **The Power of Culture**: Culture and the arts remain a central theme, with literature, music, and fine dining serving as lifelines for Rostov. They offer not only personal solace but also a way to connect with others and maintain a sense of continuity with the world beyond the hotel's walls.

9. **The Interplay of History and Personal Narrative**: The novel intertwines Rostov's personal story with the broader sweep of history, showing how individual lives are affected by political and social forces. Rostov's aristocratic background becomes a counterpoint to the new Soviet reality, offering insight into the tensions of the time.

10. **The Journey Toward Freedom**: Ultimately, "A Gentleman in Moscow" is a meditation on the concept of freedom. Rostov's journey is not just a physical one towards eventual escape but also an internal quest for self-fulfillment and autonomy within the constraints imposed upon him.
