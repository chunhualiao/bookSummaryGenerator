I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a summary of "Peter Cornelius: Ein Deutscher Maler" by David Koch as it is not a book within my database prior to my last update in 2023. However, I can offer some general insights about Peter Cornelius as an artist, which might be in line with what such a book would cover:

1. **Historical Context**: Peter Cornelius (1783-1867) was a German painter associated with the Nazarene movement, which sought to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art.

2. **Artistic Philosophy**: Cornelius and his contemporaries were dissatisfied with the contemporary academic art of their time. They looked back to medieval and early Renaissance art for inspiration, emphasizing pious and narrative-driven works.

3. **Influence of Italy**: Like many of his Nazarene peers, Cornelius spent significant time in Rome, which was a center for artists seeking to study the works of the Renaissance and to collaborate on new, spiritually infused artworks.

4. **Major Works**: Cornelius is known for several large fresco cycles, such as those in the Ludwigskirche in Munich and the Glyptothek. His work is characterized by clear outlines, strong colors, and monumental figures.

5. **Role as a Teacher**: Cornelius also played a role in educating the next generation of artists as the director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, influencing the development of 19th-century German art.

6. **Political Influence**: His work has been interpreted as part of the larger German Romantic movement, which was connected to the growing sense of national identity and the political aspirations of a unified Germany.

7. **Religious Inspiration**: Cornelius's art is deeply rooted in Christian iconography and narratives, and he aimed to convey moral and spiritual messages through his biblical scenes and characters.

8. **Legacy and Reception**: While his style fell out of favor in the later 19th century with the rise of Realism and other movements, Cornelius's contribution to German art history and the Nazarene movement remains significant.

9. **Technique and Style**: Cornelius's technique often involved preparatory drawings and cartoons for his frescoes, showing a meticulous approach to composition and design. His style reflects a synthesis of classical forms with a Romantic sensibility.

10. **Collaborations and Community**: As part of the Nazarene movement, Cornelius worked closely with other artists such as Friedrich Overbeck and Franz Pforr, fostering a community of like-minded individuals who shared artistic and spiritual goals.

While these insights are based on general knowledge about Peter Cornelius and his era, a book specifically about him by David Koch would likely delve deeper into these topics, providing detailed analysis of individual works, personal correspondence, and contemporary reactions to his art. For a precise summary of the book's content, it would be necessary to read the book itself or access a detailed review or summary from a reader or critic who has done so.
