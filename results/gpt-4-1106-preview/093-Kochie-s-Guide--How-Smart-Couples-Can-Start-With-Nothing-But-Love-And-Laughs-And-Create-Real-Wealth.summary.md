7. **Insurance and Protection**: Having the right insurance coverage is essential to protect the couple's financial future. This includes life, health, home, and income protection insurance. The Kochs offer advice on choosing the right policies and ensuring adequate coverage.

8. **Retirement Planning**: It's never too early to start planning for retirement. The book guides couples on how to take advantage of retirement savings accounts, employer contributions, and other tools to ensure a comfortable retirement.

9. **Estate Planning**: The Kochs highlight the importance of estate planning, including writing wills and setting up powers of attorney. This ensures that the couple's wealth is distributed according to their wishes and that their loved ones are taken care of.

10. **Maintaining Balance**: Finally, the Kochs remind couples that while building wealth is important, it should not come at the cost of their relationship or happiness. They advocate for maintaining a balance between financial goals and enjoying life together.
