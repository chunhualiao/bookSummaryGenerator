1. **Good and Evil Coexistence**: The novel portrays the interplay between good and evil as complex and intertwined. Woland (the Devil) and his entourage display both malevolence and benevolence, suggesting that evil is not just a destructive force but also a necessary one that brings truth and retribution.

2. **Power of Art and Creation**: The Master, an author who writes a novel about Pontius Pilate, represents the struggles of an artist in a suppressive society. His work is a testament to the enduring power of creation, as his story survives despite societal rejection and personal despair, emphasizing the immortality of art.

3. **Critique of Soviet Society**: Through satire and fantasy, Bulgakov critiques the atheistic, materialistic Soviet society of his time. The absurdities and vanities of Moscow’s citizens are exposed by the supernatural chaos caused by Woland’s visit, revealing the hypocrisy and corruption beneath the surface of Soviet life.

4. **Spiritual and Religious Themes**: The novel delves into deep spiritual questions, particularly through the story of Pontius Pilate, which runs parallel to the main plot. This narrative wrestles with issues of faith, redemption, and the moral ambiguities of power and cowardice.

5. **Love and Sacrifice**: Margarita's unwavering love for the Master demonstrates the theme of love as a redemptive and sacrificial force. Her willingness to endure trials for the sake of love ultimately leads to their reunion and salvation, underscoring the transformative power of love.

6. **Freedom and Free Will**: Characters in the novel grapple with the concept of freedom and the consequences of their choices. The notion of free will is central to the narrative, with characters making pivotal decisions that affect their fates, illustrating the human condition's perpetual struggle between destiny and autonomy.

7. **Duality of Reality**: Bulgakov blurs the lines between fantasy and reality, creating a world where the supernatural is commonplace and the ordinary becomes extraordinary. This duality challenges the reader’s perception of what is real, suggesting that reality is more complex and multidimensional than it appears.

8. **Social Satire**: The absurdities and petty concerns of Moscow's literary and theatrical elite are lampooned throughout the novel. Bulgakov uses satire to expose the emptiness of their pursuits and the superficiality of their social status, critiquing the cultural and moral bankruptcy of the time.

9. **The Role of Suffering**: The characters’ various forms of suffering, from the Master’s despair to Margarita’s anguish, serve as a crucible for character development. Suffering is portrayed as an inevitable aspect of the human experience that can lead to personal growth, enlightenment, or in some cases, retribution.

10. **Ambiguity and Interpretation**: Bulgakov leaves much of the novel open to interpretation, with many events and characters having multiple layers of meaning. This ambiguity invites readers to explore their own beliefs and draw their own conclusions, making "The Master and Margarita" a rich text for analysis and discussion.
