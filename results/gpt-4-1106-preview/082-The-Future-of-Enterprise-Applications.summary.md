I apologize for any inconvenience, but I don't have access to a specific database of books, including "The Future of Enterprise Applications" by Bernd Leukert and Hasso Plattner. Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of a book that is not within my training data. However, I can offer you a general insight into the themes and topics that such a book by experts in enterprise software might cover:

1. **Digital Transformation**: The book likely discusses how enterprise applications are at the heart of digital transformation, enabling businesses to adapt to changing markets and customer expectations.

2. **Cloud Computing**: A key insight would be the shift from on-premises software to cloud-based services, offering scalability, flexibility, and cost savings.

3. **Data Analytics and Big Data**: The authors probably emphasize the importance of leveraging data analytics and big data for better decision-making and predictive insights.

4. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: Insights into how AI and ML are integrated into enterprise applications to automate processes, provide personalized experiences, and enhance business intelligence.

5. **User Experience**: The authors likely highlight the importance of user-centric design in enterprise applications to increase productivity and user satisfaction.

6. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Discussion on the impact of IoT on enterprise applications, enabling real-time data collection and analysis for improved operational efficiency.

7. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**: Insights into the evolution of ERP systems and how they serve as the backbone for integrating various business processes.

8. **Customization vs. Standardization**: The book might explore the balance between customizable solutions that cater to specific business needs and standardized software that offers best practices and cost-efficiency.

10. **Future Trends and Innovations**: The authors probably discuss emerging technologies and trends that will shape the future of enterprise applications, such as blockchain, edge computing, and augmented reality.

Please note that these points are based on general knowledge about enterprise applications and the reputations of the authors. For a precise summary of the book's content, accessing the actual text would be necessary. If you have access to the book or specific sections you would like to discuss, feel free to share, and I can help with that.
