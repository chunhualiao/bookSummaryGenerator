1. **Power of Friendship**: At the heart of the narrative is the deep bond among the Gentleman Bastards, especially between Locke and his closest friend, Jean Tannen. Their loyalty and camaraderie are central to their success and survival, showing the strength found in chosen family and the trust necessary for intricate cons.

2. **Skillful Deception**: Locke Lamora's life is a testament to the power of wit and deception over brute force. The Gentleman Bastards are masters of disguise and manipulation, using their intellect to outsmart their marks. Their elaborate schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of cleverness and planning in achieving goals.

3. **Class Struggle**: Camorr is a city deeply divided by class, with the wealthy nobles living in stark contrast to the commoners and thieves. Locke's cons often target the rich, showcasing the theme of class struggle and the desire for retribution against an unjust social hierarchy.

4. **Mentorship and Growth**: The character of Father Chains, the leader who trains the Gentleman Bastards, illustrates the impact of mentorship on personal growth. His guidance shapes the group's moral compass and skills, highlighting the importance of leadership and education in developing young talent.

5. **Revenge and Justice**: The novel explores the concept of revenge, particularly through Locke's vendetta against the Gray King, who disrupts the underworld's balance. This quest for vengeance raises questions about justice, morality, and the consequences of pursuing retribution at all costs.

6. **Identity and Role-Playing**: Locke's ability to assume various identities is not just a conning technique but also a commentary on self-perception and the fluidity of identity. The characters often question who they genuinely are beneath the roles they play, reflecting on the masks people wear in society.

7. **Love and Sacrifice**: While romance is not the central theme, Locke's unspoken love for Sabetha and the sacrifices he makes for his friends show the depth of emotion and the lengths to which people will go for love, both platonic and romantic.

8. **Corruption and Morality**: The corrupt officials and the secret peace among Camorr's criminal gangs reveal the blurred lines between right and wrong. The Gentleman Bastards operate within this moral ambiguity, navigating a world where honor among thieves is a complex and tenuous concept.

9. **Fantasy World-Building**: The city of Camorr, with its Venice-like canals and Elderglass structures, is a character in itself. The richly described setting with its unique customs, alchemical wonders, and mysterious past contributes to an immersive fantasy world that is integral to the story's atmosphere.

10. **Resilience and Adaptability**: Throughout the novel, Locke and his crew face numerous setbacks, from personal losses to the complete unraveling of their plans. Their resilience and ability to adapt to changing circumstances are crucial survival traits, echoing the theme that flexibility and resourcefulness are often more valuable than rigid strength.
