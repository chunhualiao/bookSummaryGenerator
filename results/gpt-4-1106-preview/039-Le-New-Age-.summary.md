I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a summary of "Le New Age" by Renaud Marhic and Emmanuel Besnier since it is not a book within my training data, and I do not have access to external databases or books to read or summarize their contents. However, I can offer you some general insights about the New Age movement, which may be relevant to the themes discussed in the book.

1. **Holistic Spirituality**: One of the core tenets of the New Age movement is a holistic approach to spirituality that blends elements from various religious traditions, mysticism, and esoteric philosophies to create a personalized spiritual practice.

2. **Self-empowerment**: New Age thought often emphasizes the empowerment of the individual, encouraging personal growth, self-healing, and a belief in one's ability to manifest oneâ€™s destiny.

3. **Eclectic Practices**: Practitioners of New Age spirituality often engage in a variety of practices such as meditation, yoga, reiki, astrology, and the use of crystals, all believed to enhance personal well-being and spiritual growth.

4. **New Consciousness**: The movement proposes a shift towards a new consciousness that emphasizes interconnectedness, peace, and ecological harmony, often associated with the belief in an impending age of enlightenment.

5. **Alternative Healing**: New Age adherents frequently explore alternative medicine and holistic healing methods, which they believe work in harmony with the body's natural energy systems and can complement or replace traditional medicine.

6. **Channeling and Mediumship**: There is a belief in the ability to communicate with spiritual entities, guides, or ascended masters through channeling or mediumship, which is seen as a way to gain higher wisdom and guidance.

7. **Ancient Wisdom**: The movement often looks to ancient civilizations like Atlantis or Lemuria, or to Eastern philosophies, as sources of hidden or lost wisdom that can inform contemporary spiritual practices.

8. **Psychic Development**: Developing psychic abilities such as clairvoyance, telepathy, or astral projection is often pursued within the New Age community as a means to expand one's consciousness and spiritual capability.

9. **Science and Spirituality**: There is an interest in bridging the gap between science and spirituality, with some New Age thinkers incorporating concepts from quantum physics to explain metaphysical phenomena.

10. **Cultural Syncretism**: The New Age movement is characterized by a syncretic approach, freely combining elements from different cultures and traditions without strict adherence to any one religious or spiritual framework.
