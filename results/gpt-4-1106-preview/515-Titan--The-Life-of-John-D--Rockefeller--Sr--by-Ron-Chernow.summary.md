1. **Monopolistic Ambitions**: John D. Rockefeller, Sr. was the founder of Standard Oil, a company that epitomized the Gilded Age's monopolistic business practices. Through shrewd and often ruthless strategies, Rockefeller dominated the oil industry, employing tactics like secret rebates, espionage, and price wars to eliminate competition.

2. **Strategic Philanthropy**: Rockefeller was a pioneer in strategic philanthropy, carefully managing his image and legacy through calculated acts of charity. He established numerous foundations and institutions, including the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, using his wealth to influence education, science, and public health.

3. **Personal Frugality, Professional Extravagance**: Despite his vast wealth, Rockefeller maintained a personal lifestyle marked by frugality and simplicity. However, professionally, he spared no expense to expand his business empire and consolidate his control over the oil industry.

4. **Early Life and Business Acumen**: Rockefeller's upbringing in upstate New York, influenced by his mother's strict Baptist values and his father's questionable business ethics, laid the foundation for his future endeavors. His entry into the oil business through a refinery in Cleveland showcased his business acumen and foresight in recognizing the potential of the burgeoning oil industry.

5. **Innovations in Industry**: Rockefeller was a visionary in industrial organization, streamlining operations, investing in research and development, and implementing vertical integration to control every aspect of oil production, from drilling to distribution. This efficiency underpinned Standard Oil's success and became a model for future conglomerates.

6. **Legal Challenges and Public Outcry**: As Rockefeller's empire grew, so did the public outcry against his monopolistic practices. The landmark 1911 Supreme Court case, which resulted in the dissolution of Standard Oil into 34 separate companies, was a direct response to these practices and a pivotal moment in antitrust law.

7. **Family and Personal Life**: Rockefeller's personal life was marked by a deep religious faith, a commitment to his family, and a detachment from the day-to-day operations of his business in later years. His relationships with his children, especially his son John D. Rockefeller Jr., were complex, as he instilled in them the same principles of philanthropy and business ethics.

8. **Influence on American Capitalism**: Rockefeller's life and career had a lasting impact on American capitalism. He was both a captain of industry and a robber baron, embodying the contradictions of America's industrial expansionâ€”innovation coupled with exploitation, and philanthropy alongside greed.

9. **Health and Longevity**: Despite the stress of his business pursuits, Rockefeller lived a long life, reaching the age of 97. His attention to diet, exercise, and a balanced lifestyle, as well as advancements in medicine, contributed to his longevity.

10. **Legacy and Historical Perception**: Rockefeller's legacy is dualistic; he is remembered as both a ruthless monopolist and a benevolent philanthropist.
