"When the Wolves Bite" by Scott Wapner is a detailed account of the epic battle between two billionaire investors, Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, over the nutritional supplement company Herbalife. Here are the ten most crucial insights from the book, presented in a concise summary:

1. **The Power of Activist Investors**: The book highlights the significant influence that activist investors like Icahn and Ackman can have on companies. Their public positions can affect stock prices, management decisions, and the overall direction of a business.

2. **The Role of Persuasion and Media**: Wapner shows how both Icahn and Ackman used the media to advocate for their positions. Ackman's initial presentation and subsequent interviews, along with Icahn's counterarguments on live television, demonstrate the importance of narrative and public perception in financial battles.

3. **Herbalife's Business Model Scrutiny**: Ackman's claim that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme brought attention to multi-level marketing (MLM) business models. The book delves into the complexities of MLMs and the fine line they walk between legitimate business and exploitative practices.

4. **Regulatory Involvement**: The clash between Ackman and Icahn drew the attention of regulators like the FTC, highlighting how high-profile investor disputes can lead to government action. This underscores the potential consequences of such battles extending beyond the market.

5. **The Importance of Due Diligence**: Ackman's exhaustive research into Herbalife before taking his short position exemplifies the deep level of due diligence that investors often undertake. However, the book also shows that even thorough research can lead to different conclusions and outcomes.

6. **Market Manipulation Concerns**: "When the Wolves Bite" raises questions about market manipulation, as the aggressive tactics used by both Icahn and Ackman could be seen as attempts to sway stock prices in their favor.

7. **The Personal Nature of Financial Feuds**: The book reveals how financial disputes can become personal vendettas. The longstanding antagonism between Icahn and Ackman added a layer of complexity to their Herbalife positions, turning a financial disagreement into a personal battle.

8. **The Impact on Stakeholders**: Wapner doesn't overlook the effects of this battle on the wider community, including Herbalife's employees, distributors, and customers. The volatility in Herbalife's stock and the uncertainty about its future had real-world consequences for many people.

9. **The Uncertainty of High-Stakes Investing**: The fluctuating fortunes of Herbalife's stock during the conflict illustrate the uncertainties inherent in high-stakes investing. Despite all the analysis and strategic moves, the outcome was far from certain, and the book captures this tension.

10. **The Resolution and Aftermath**: Ultimately, the Herbalife saga concluded with Ackman exiting his short position and the FTC settlement that restructured Herbalife's operations but did not label it a pyramid scheme. Icahn emerged with a profitable stake. This resolution underscores the unpredictable nature of such investment wars and the difficulty in declaring a clear winner.

In summary, "When the Wolves Bite" is a riveting exploration of a high-profile financial duel that offers insights into the strategies and psychologies of top investors, the regulatory landscape, the power of the media in financial markets, and the broader implications for the economy and society. It serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities and risks associated with activist investing and the unpredictable outcomes of market battles.
