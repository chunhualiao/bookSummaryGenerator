"Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down" by J.E. Gordon delves into the fundamental principles behind the stability and strength of various structures. Here are the ten key insights from the book:

1. **Material Properties**: Understanding the properties of different materials is crucial in designing structures. Materials like steel and concrete have specific strengths and weaknesses that must be considered.

2. **Forces and Stresses**: Structures experience various forces such as tension, compression, bending, and torsion. These forces create stresses within the structure, and engineers must design to ensure these stresses remain within safe limits.

3. **Load Distribution**: The distribution of loads within a structure is essential for its stability. Proper load distribution ensures that each component of the structure carries its share of the weight efficiently.

4. **Shapes and Forms**: The shape and form of a structure play a significant role in its strength. Certain geometric shapes, such as triangles, are inherently stable and can withstand external forces better.

5. **Failure Modes**: Structures can fail in different ways, including buckling, shearing, and bending. Understanding these failure modes helps engineers anticipate potential weaknesses and design structures to prevent failure.

6. **Safety Factors**: Engineers incorporate safety factors into their designs to account for uncertainties and unforeseen circumstances. Safety factors ensure that structures can withstand loads beyond their expected limits without failing.

7. **Architectural Wonders**: The book explores various architectural wonders like the Eiffel Tower and the Sydney Opera House, highlighting how innovative design and engineering principles are used to create iconic structures that defy gravity.

8. **Historical Perspectives**: Gordon provides historical insights into the evolution of structural engineering, showcasing how ancient civilizations like the Romans and Egyptians employed basic principles of structural stability in their architectural achievements.

9. **Innovative Materials**: Advances in materials science have revolutionized the field of structural engineering. New materials like carbon fiber composites offer high strength-to-weight ratios, allowing for the construction of lighter and more resilient structures.

10. **Practical Applications**: The book emphasizes the practical applications of structural engineering principles in everyday life, from bridges and skyscrapers to bicycles and furniture. Understanding these principles can help individuals appreciate the engineering marvels that surround them.

Overall, "Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down" provides a comprehensive exploration of the underlying principles that govern the stability and strength of structures. By delving into material properties, forces, load distribution, shapes, failure modes, safety factors, architectural wonders, historical perspectives, innovative materials, and practical applications, the book offers valuable insights for engineers, architects, and anyone interested in the built environment.
