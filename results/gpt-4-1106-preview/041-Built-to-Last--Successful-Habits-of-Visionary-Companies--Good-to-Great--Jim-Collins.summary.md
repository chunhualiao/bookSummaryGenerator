"Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras is a research-based book that explores what makes certain companies exceptionally successful over long periods. The book identifies distinctive practices and characteristics of "visionary companies" that have stood the test of time. Here are the ten most important insights from the book, summarized in 550 words:

1. **Core Ideology and Visionary Goals**: Visionary companies have a core ideology – a set of values and a sense of purpose beyond just making money – that guides and inspires them. They also set audacious goals that push the company to achieve extraordinary results.

2. **Preserve the Core/Stimulate Progress**: Successful companies adhere to their core values and purpose while simultaneously embracing progress and innovation. They understand that they must change and adapt strategies and practices, but their core ideology remains unchanged.

3. **Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs)**: Visionary companies use BHAGs to stimulate progress. These are bold, long-term objectives that are clear and compelling, serving as a unifying focal point for the organization.

4. **Cult-Like Cultures**: These companies have strong cultures that are so pervasive they can be termed "cult-like." They indoctrinate employees into their specific ideologies, making it clear what the company stands for.

5. **Try a Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works**: Visionary companies are not necessarily more innovative than others, but they are excellent at trying many different things and keeping what works. They accept failures as part of the process and learn from them.

6. **Home-Grown Management**: Instead of looking outside for top management, successful companies tend to promote from within. This practice preserves the core ideology and encourages a long-term commitment to the company and its values.

7. **Good Enough Never Is**: Visionary companies never settle for "good enough." They are continually pushing for improvement and excellence, which drives them forward and keeps them at the top of their industries.

8. **The Flywheel and the Doom Loop**: Success comes from a consistent direction and accumulation of efforts, like a heavy flywheel that takes a lot of pushing to get started but then builds momentum. Conversely, companies that jump from strategy to strategy without gaining momentum are in a "doom loop."

9. **Clock Building, Not Time Telling**: The authors emphasize the importance of building a company that can endure and succeed beyond any single product cycle or market trend. This means focusing on building an organization, rather than hitting short-term targets.

10. **Reject the "Tyranny of the 'OR'":** Visionary companies reject the idea that they must choose between two seemingly contradictory options, such as profitability or social responsibility. They embrace the "genius of the 'AND'", finding ways to have both.

In conclusion, "Built to Last" provides a framework for understanding what separates visionary companies from the rest. These companies are guided by a core ideology, set BHAGs, have cult-like cultures, try many things and keep what works, grow their own managers, never settle for mediocrity, understand the importance of momentum, focus on building enduring institutions, and avoid false dichotomies. The insights from Collins and Porras' research offer valuable lessons for any organization seeking to achieve long-term success and leave a lasting impact.
