I'm sorry, but I couldn't find a book with the exact title "Notebook: You Have The Same Amount Of Hours In A Day As Masayoshi Son" by Masayoshi Son. It's possible that the book is not widely known or may not exist. If you have any other specific information or details about the book, I'd be happy to help summarize it for you.
