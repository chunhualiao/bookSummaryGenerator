9. **The Decline of Progressivism**: The decline of progressivism in the aftermath of Taft's presidency reflected a shifting political landscape and the challenges of maintaining momentum for reform. Internal divisions within the Republican Party and external pressures contributed to the waning influence of the progressive movement.
