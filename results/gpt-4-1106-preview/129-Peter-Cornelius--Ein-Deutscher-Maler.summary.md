As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific books or their contents, including "Peter Cornelius: Ein Deutscher Maler" by David Koch. However, I can provide you with a general framework for what such a summary might include if one were to read and distill the key insights from the book. 

1. **Biographical Overview**: The book likely starts with an introduction to Peter Cornelius's life, highlighting his birth in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, in 1783, his artistic development, and his influence on German art. This section may emphasize Cornelius's early years, education, and the mentors who shaped his artistic vision.

2. **Artistic Philosophy**: Cornelius was a central figure in the German Romantic movement, and the book would explore his philosophy of art, which often focused on idealism, nationalism, and the use of symbolism. His belief in the power of art to embody cultural and spiritual ideals would be a key insight.

3. **Major Works**: A significant portion of the text would be dedicated to Cornelius's most important artworks. This would include his frescoes, illustrations, and mural designs. Specific works like "The Last Judgment" and his contributions to the frescoes in the Ludwigskirche in Munich would be analyzed for their style and thematic content.

4. **Nazarene Movement**: As a co-founder of the Nazarene movement, which sought to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art, Cornelius's role in this group would be a central theme. The book would detail how this movement influenced art across Europe and Cornelius's contributions to its ideals and aesthetics.

5. **Influence on German Art**: Cornelius's impact on the course of German art would be examined, particularly how his work inspired a generation of artists and thinkers. His role in shaping the direction of the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he served as a director, would be highlighted.

6. **Political and Cultural Context**: The book would provide insight into the political and cultural milieu of Cornelius's time, including the rise of German nationalism and how it intersected with the Romantic movement. The author might discuss how Cornelius's work reflected or contributed to the societal changes of the period.

7. **Technique and Style**: An analysis of Cornelius's artistic techniques and his evolving style throughout his career would be important. This would include his approach to composition, his use of color (or lack thereof, in many of his frescoes and drawings), and his draftsmanship.

8. **Collaborations and Influences**: Cornelius worked with many prominent figures of his time, and the book would explore these relationships and their impact on his work. Collaborations with other artists, architects, and patrons would be detailed, as well as his influence on and from other European artists.

9. **Legacy and Critique**: The author would assess Cornelius's legacy, considering both the admiration and criticism his work has received over time. This might include discussions of his role in the canon of art history and the varying interpretations of his work in different eras.

10. **Visual Documentation**: As a book about a visual artist, it would include reproductions of Cornelius's works and possibly sketches or preliminary drawings. These visual elements would serve to illustrate points made in the text and give readers a direct sense of Cornelius's art.

This framework provides a rough outline of the key insights one might expect from a comprehensive study of Peter Cornelius's life and work. However, to obtain an accurate summary, one would need to read the specific book in question.
