I apologize for any inconvenience, but I do not have access to the full text of books or external databases to provide summaries, and "Shine ansuroporojiÌ„ : jinruigaku no arata na jissen e" does not appear to be a widely recognized title in my current database as of my last update in 2023. This might be due to a variety of reasons such as the book being very new, having limited distribution, or being a title in a language that is not widely cataloged in international databases.

If this is a specialized academic text or a book not widely available in English-speaking countries, it may not be possible to provide a detailed summary without direct access to the content. If you have access to the book or specific areas of interest within it, I would be happy to help summarize or discuss those if you provide the text or the main points.

Alternatively, if you are looking for insights on a particular topic related to anthropology, which is suggested by the term "ansuroporoji" (likely a transliteration of "anthropology" in Japanese), I could provide general information on that topic. If you can provide more context or clarify your needs, I'll do my best to assist you with the information I have available.
