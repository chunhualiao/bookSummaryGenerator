I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a summary of the book "Regard sur la Bible; mieux se comprendre entre juifs et catholiques" by Francoise Bettencourt Meyers as it is a copyrighted work, and I do not have access to its contents to summarize it. However, I can discuss the general themes and topics that such a book might cover, based on the title and the known interests of the author. If that would be helpful, please let me know.
